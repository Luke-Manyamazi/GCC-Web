            Grace Chapter Church is led by Pastors Dan and Ria Zimuwandeyi,
            whose passion is to see Christ formed in people and families
            restored by the Word of Grace. With a deep commitment to teaching,
            shepherding, and empowering others, they have laid a strong
            foundation for the church's house church model and international
            outreach. Their leadership is marked by humility, vision, and a
            desire to see every believer grow in faith and purpose. They are
            supported by an incredible team of Campus Pastors across all
            locations, who ensure that each local church thrives in unity, love,
            and spiritual maturity. Together, they steward the vision God has
            given for Grace Chapter Church: to raise strong families, serve
            communities, and reveal Christ to the world.
